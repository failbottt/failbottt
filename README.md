### Hi! I'm Michael.

I've been programming for a decade.

My favorite languages are C and Go, but I'm comfortable in many other languages.

Some things about me:

* **Mission focused**: I do my best to place the team and mission first.
* **Utility player**: I'm proficient in many different programming environments, and I have a knack for maintaining disaster-zone, legacy systems.
* **Comfortable with uncertainty**: I'm okay with undefined goals, and I'll ask the "stupid" questions in order to figure things out.
* **Pragmatic**: I understand most systems are not ideal, and I'm okay with writing the code that gets the job done.

##### Languages
* C
* Go
* JavaScript
* Typescript
* Bash
* PHP
* Python
